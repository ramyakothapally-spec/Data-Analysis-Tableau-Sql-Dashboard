# Pizza-Sales-Data-Analysis(Interactive Dashboard creation using SQL and Tableau)
## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to to analyze and visualize pizza sales data to uncover key trends and insights for better business decisions. Visualizations should include a stacked bar chart for hourly pizza sales trends, a line chart for weekly order activity, and a pie chart for sales distribution by pizza category. These insights should help optimize customer behavior analysis, marketing, inventory, and operations strategies.

## Dataset used

## Questions(KPIs)
We need to analyze key indicators for our pizza sales data to gain insights into our business performance. Specifically, we want to calculate the following metrics:
- Total Revenue: The sum of the total price of all pizza orders.
- Average Order Value: The average amount spent per order, calculated by dividing the total revenue by the total number of orders.
- Total Pizzas Sold: The sum of the quantities of all pizzas sold.
- Total Orders: The total number of orders placed.
- Average Pizzas Per Order: The average number of pizzas sold per order, calculated by dividing the total number of pizzas sold by the total number of orders.
- Hourly Trend for Total Pizzas Sold:Create a stacked bar chart that displays the hourly trend of total orders over a specific time period
- Weekly Trend for Total Orders:Create a line chart that illustrates the weekly trend of total orders throughout the year
- Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category:Create a pie chart that shows the distribution of sales across different pizza categories
- Percentage of Sales by Pizza Size:Generate a pie chart that represents the percentage of sales attributed to different pizza sizes
- Total Pizzas Sold by Pizza Category:Create a funnel chart that presents the total number of pizzas sold for each pizza category
- Top 5 Best Sellers by Revenue, Total Quantity and Total Orders:Create a bar chart highlighting the top 5 best-selling pizzas based on the Revenue, Total Quantity, Total Orders
- Bottom 5 Best Sellers by Revenue, Total Quantity and Total Orders:Create a bar chart showcasing the bottom 5 worst-selling pizzas based on the Revenue, Total Quantity, Total Orders

## Process for Creating the Tableau Dashboard
- Data Preparation: Clean and preprocess the pizza sales dataset, ensuring accurate calculations for metrics such as total sales, orders, and - category-wise breakdowns.
- Connect to Tableau: Import the cleaned data into Tableau and create calculated fields for key metrics (e.g., revenue, average order value, and --percentage contributions).
- Design Visualizations: Build interactive charts, including stacked bar charts for hourly trends, line charts for weekly orders, and pie charts - for category-wise sales distribution.
- Dashboard Integration: Combine all visualizations into a single, user-friendly dashboard, enabling dynamic filtering and insights.

## Project Insights
- Revenue and Order Metrics: The total revenue from pizza sales is significant, with average order values indicating healthy customer spending habits. The average number of pizzas per order further suggests customer preferences for multiple purchases in a single order.
- Sales by Time: Hourly and weekly trends show peak sales hours and weeks, providing valuable insights for optimizing operations and staffing.
- Category and Size Preferences: Classic pizza categories and large sizes dominate sales, indicating their popularity among customers.
- Top Performers: The top 5 pizzas by revenue, quantity, and orders reveal the best-selling options, enabling targeted promotions.

## Final Conclusion
To improve sales performance and customer satisfaction, focus on optimizing operations during peak hours and leveraging popular products through targeted promotions. Address underperforming pizzas by refining recipes, pricing, or marketing efforts. Introduce time-sensitive offers during non-peak periods to boost revenue and ensure consistent sales. Additionally, implement customer feedback mechanisms and loyalty programs to enhance service quality and foster long-term customer loyalty. These strategies will drive sustained growth and improve the overall customer experience.
